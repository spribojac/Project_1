# Conclusion and Final Thoughts - COVID Report

In this analysis, we explored the intricate relationship between various socio-economic factors and their potential impact on handling the COVID-19 pandemic. Let's recap our key findings:

## GDP and Happiness:

We found a significant association between a country's GDP and its reported happiness. Countries with higher GDP tend to have a more favorable happiness score.

## GDP AND SOCIAL SUPPORT:

WE found that there is no significant association between the GDP and Social Support .Countries with higher GDP tend to have a less Social Support.

## Happiness Score and Generosity:

WE found that there is no significant association between the Happiness Score  and Generosity .Countries with higher Happiness Score tend to have a less Generosity.

## Government Corruption Perception:

Countries with a lower perception of government corruption were likely to have a more positive outlook on happiness, suggesting the importance of transparent and accountable governance.

## Life Expectancy and COVID-19:

Although not directly analyzed in this dataset, life expectancy is a vital indicator of overall health and well-being, likely affecting how countries handle the pandemic.

## Social Support and COVID-19:

Strong social support seems to correlate with better compliance with preventive measures, potentially contributing to lower COVID-19 transmission rates.

While GDP, corruption perception, life expectancy, and social support are vital factors, managing a pandemic like COVID-19 is a multidimensional challenge. It requires a holistic approach, considering healthcare infrastructure, public health policies, education, cultural factors, and more.

Understanding these relationships is crucial for policymakers and public health experts in crafting effective strategies to combat the current pandemic and future health crises. By addressing these factors, we can work towards a more resilient and healthier global community.

## Introduction

The year 2020 brought unprecedented challenges to the world, primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While the pandemic itself had a direct impact on public health, it also had indirect consequences on various aspects of society, including people's overall well-being and happiness. This analysis aims to shed light on the relationship between the severity of COVID-19 outbreaks in different countries and their respective happiness levels.

## Data Import 

### COVID-19 Death Dataset

We start by importing and preprocessing the COVID-19 death dataset. The dataset contains information about COVID-19 deaths in various countries and regions. We clean and aggregate the data to make it suitable for analysis.

### Worldwide Happiness Report

Next, we import the Worldwide Happiness Report, which includes happiness scores and various factors contributing to happiness, such as GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, and freedom to make life choices. We also clean and prepare this dataset for analysis.

### COVID-19 Death Progression in Specific Countries

We begin our analysis by visualizing the progression of COVID-19 deaths in specific countries. The graph below illustrates the death toll over time for selected countries, offering insights into how the pandemic evolved in different regions.

### Rate of COVID-19 Death Curve

To understand the rate of change in COVID-19 deaths, we present the death rate curve. This curve shows how quickly or slowly COVID-19 deaths increased in specific countries, allowing us to identify trends and critical periods.

### Maximum COVID-19 Death Rate

We identify and list the maximum death rates observed for specific countries. This information provides a glimpse into the most challenging periods these countries faced during the pandemic.

### Scatter Plot: Correlation between Covid19 Deaths and Happiness KPIs

Moving beyond COVID-19 data, we explore the correlation between GDP per capita and happiness scores. The scatter plot below illustrates this relationship, highlighting how economic prosperity might influence people's happiness.

## Conclusion

This analysis offers a comprehensive look at the interplay between the COVID-19 pandemic and happiness levels across different countries. By visualizing COVID-19 death progression, identifying critical periods, and exploring correlations with various factors, we aim to contribute to a better understanding of the pandemic's broader impact on societies.
